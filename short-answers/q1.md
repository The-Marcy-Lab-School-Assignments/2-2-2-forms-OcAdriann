# Question
Say I have a form on a page with an input for a user's email and password. When you click the submit button, suddenly the url goes from:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/
```
to this:
```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/?email=tom%40gmail.com&password=123456
```

The whole page refreshed as well. Why did that happen, and how can we stop it?

# Answer
The URL changed because old forms use attributes like `action` and `method`. The methods that are being used are `get` and `post`, basically it's requesting the data from the form and sending the data to be stored by the application. The form sata becomes `query params` in the URL. to prevent this from happening, we use `event.preventDefault()` to stop the page from reloading.
